# LevelDB From Scratch

This is a simple Level DB implementation in Go aiming for helping people
understand LevelDB. It is not production ready, feature complete, or
optimized. The goal would be understandability.

To help with that, several branches are created to show how each step is
done.

## Step 1: MemTable

MemTable is a in-memory key value store. In LevelDB, new key value pairs
are inserted into MemTable first. When the table is full, it would be
finalized as a SSTable and written to disk.

In this step, we focus on MemTable without implementing SSTable, WAL,
etc.
